        Hi! nice to meet you :) 
        We are Tomer Pinto and Shimrit Herbst, decided to 'join forces' for the third sprint of 
        Full-Stack development course by Coding Academy. 
        We had a great time working together, and can say out load that this was an intense 
        but good experience.
